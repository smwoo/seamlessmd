Given a basic scheduling software system for patient appointments that sends out emails 24 hours before the scheduled time to the patient email as a reminder. Describe some tests you would write to ensure things were working and scenarios that you might attempt to break the system.

- Test the function that generates the email content to make sure that the proper content is generated
- stub the function that sends out the email, then use a test framework that lets you manipulate the system time to see if the function is called 24 hours before
- stub the return of the function that sends out the email to test how it responds to success/failure

edge cases:
- daylight savings time?
- store everything in utctime to avoid dealing with timezones
